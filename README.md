<h1>Dynamic encryption</h1>
<p>The main purpose for this library is to encrypt strings with RSA encryption and make it not dependant to public key/private key:<p>
<p>Which mean even if you have the key, you can't encrypt/decrypt the string using RSA (RSA iso)</p>

RSA is simply the algorithm of Rijndael, by using
